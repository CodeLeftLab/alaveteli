    <strong>Alaveteli</strong> is the name of the open source software platform created
    by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a> for submitting,
    managing and archiving Freedom of Information requests.
    <p>
      It grew from the successful FOI UK project 
      <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com">WhatDoTheyKnow</a>.
      We use the name <em>Alaveteli</em> to distinguish the software
      that runs the platform from any specific website that it is powering.

          The name "Alaveteli" comes from

          where 
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Chydenius">an early FOI campaigner</a>
          once worked.

    <strong>Freedom of information</strong> laws allow access by the general public
    to data held by national governments. They establish a "right-to-know"
    legal process by which requests may be made for government-held
    information, to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard
    exceptions.

	  A <strong>theme</strong> is the collection of changes to the templates
	  and the code that causes the site to look or behave differently from the 
	  default. Typically you'll need a theme to make Alaveteli show your own
	  brand.
